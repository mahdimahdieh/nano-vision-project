# Nano Vision Project
This project demonstrates fundamental computer vision operations using OpenCV. Key functionalities include:  
- Image processing: Loading, resizing, grayscale conversion, and display of static images  
- Geometric annotations: Drawing lines, circles, and rectangles on images  
- Face detection: Implementation of Haar Cascade classifier for facial recognition in static images  
- Real-time video processing: Webcam capture with live face detection and annotation  
- Parameter tuning: Experimentation with scale factors to optimize detection accuracy
